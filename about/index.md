I'm Riley Wood, an embedded systems engineer living in the Austin area. I like systems programming, writing software that affects the physical world, and computer architecture.

## What am I doing right now?
Currently, I am working on my Master's degree at UT Austin. I am a member of the [Spark Research Lab](http://spark.ece.utexas.edu/){:target="_blank"} where we research computer security across hardware and software. On the side, I'm learning guitar, climbing stuff, playing around in the Linux kernel, and tinkering with FPGAs.

Previously, I was working at [ClearMotion](http://clearmotion.com/){:target="_blank"}, a startup developing the world's first commercial wide-band active suspension system for automobiles.

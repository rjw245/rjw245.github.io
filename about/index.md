I'm Riley Wood, a computer systems engineer living in Austin. I like systems programming, software that interacts with the physical world, and computer architecture.

## What am I doing right now?
Currently, I am working on operating systems at Apple. On the side, I'm learning guitar, climbing stuff, playing around in the Linux kernel, and tinkering with FPGAs.

Previously, during my Master's, I was a member of the [Spark Research Lab](https://spark.ece.utexas.edu/){:target="_blank"} where we research computer security across hardware and software. And before that, I was working at [ClearMotion](https://www.clearmotion.com/){:target="_blank"}, a startup developing the world's first commercial "proactive" suspension system for automobiles.

Opinions are my own and not the views of my employer.

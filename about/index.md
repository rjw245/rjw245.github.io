I'm Riley Wood, an embedded systems engineer living in the Boston area. I like systems programming, writing software that affects the physical world, and computer architecture.

## What am I doing right now?
Right now I'm working at [ClearMotion](http://clearmotion.com/), a startup developing the world's first commercial robotic suspension for automobiles. On the side, I'm learning guitar, climbing stuff, playing around in the Linux kernel, and tinkering with FPGAs.

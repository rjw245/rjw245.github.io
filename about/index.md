Hi! My name is Riley, and in 2016 I received my Bachelor's in computer engineering from Tufts University. Ever since I began my studies, I have been interested in using software and electronics to interact with people and the physical world in interesting ways. I was introduced to embedded programming on the Arduino platform, and since then I have also worked with ARM processors and embedded Linux. I am currently employed as an embedded software engineer at [ClearMotion](http://clearmotion.com/), a startup
developing the world's most advanced fully-active, regenerative automotive suspension system.

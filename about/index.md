Hi! My name is Riley, I graduated from Tufts in 2016 with a Bachelor's in computer engineering, and ever since I began my studies I have been interested in using software and electronics to interact with people and the physical world in interesting ways. My first introduction to embedded programming was on the Arduino platform, and since then I have also worked with ARM processors and embedded Linux. I am currently employed as an embedded software engineer at [Levant Power](http://levantpower.com/), a startup
developing the world's most advanced fully-active, regenerative automotive suspension system.

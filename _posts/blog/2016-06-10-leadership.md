Two weeks ago, I graduated from college, and then shortly after, I started this blog. I'm writing this post as a kind of retrospective on my college career. I want to share with the Internet the most important lessons I learned as an undergrad. I think I'm going to split this one into two parts. In this post, I'll share a few lessons I learned as president of the Tufts robotics club. My next post will focus on the importance of lifelong learning.

It's my belief that few people consider themselves "leadership material" before stepping into their first leadership role. I certainly didn't in high school. I was and still am a very reserved person---not the type you'd think of to command the attention of a room of people. So when I was offered the opportunity to run for president of my college robotics team, I was pretty hesitant. My head swam with reasons NOT to do it.

"You're not outgoing enough, people won't respect you!"

"You'll just embarrass yourself!"

"You don't know enough. You're not qualified to be president!"

said my brain. On the other hand, in retrospect, I was a pretty good fit, and I can see why the president at the time was eying me for the job. I was passionate about Arduino programming---heck, it's what got me interested in embedded systems. I was also a core member, and hadn't missed a meeting all year. I really liked the robotics club, and saw no reason not to run for president other than the above insecurities. I managed to get over each of them and through it I
learned a few things, which I'd like to share here.

The first lesson I learned is that engaging a group of people is hard, but it's a skill that can be acquired through practice. I cringe a little bit when I think about the first robotics meeting I led. A few long-time club members gathered at my house during the summer with the goal of deciding what projects we would work on in the fall. I found myself unable to properly direct the conversation. Instead, whenever someone confident said something I liked, I would just sort of tell
them to "keep going with that." Basically, I used assertive people to talk for me. Of course, the conversation would inevitably come back around to me when it was time to make a final decision. I was terrified of making the wrong choice, so I would stall and ask other people for their opinions, further drawing out the meeting. Suffice it to say we didn't make much progress that day.

I got better at talking to groups and being assertive mainly by adjusting over time. There aren't many secrets to it, though there are some tricks I've learned. Just keep putting yourself in situations where you NEED to be confident and address a group, and eventually, it will come naturally. It's the old adage: fake it 'til you make it; in this case, fake confidence until it's real. But about those tricks! Something which helped me gain confidence was consciously acknowledging
my accomplishments as a leader. I would look around at club members enjoying themselves, building whatever they were building, and I knew that as long as people were having fun, I was doing a good job. Once I knew I was serving the group well, it became easier to address them.

So about my next worry: that I would make a mistake and ruin the club forever. How dramatic. Something to keep in mind when you're in a leadership role is that you should never take yourself too seriously. You are not the only thing keeping the organization going; if you mess up, you will all survive. The **important** thing is that you learn from your mistakes so that you don't make them again.

This actually ties into my next point: you're not the only important member of the club, so therefore you shouldn't be doing everything yourself. I found myself doing everything my first semester as president, and let me tell you, that was not a fun semester. This meant I was organizing all of our events, teaching all the lessons, making all the posters---it was hell! I was giving into my fear of not knowing enough by, well, pretending I knew how to do everything. I only did that to myself out of a fear of asking for help. So that's another
point: acknowledge and embrace the fact that you don't know what you're doing in your fancy new leadership role. Talk to people, learn from them, and most importantly, bring other people into the fold to share leadership responsibility. Ask people to organize events. Ask them to come up with new advertising strategies. The important part is to leave the creative aspect up to them. That's how you truly engage people: by letting them be creative.

In summary, there's no way you can do everything yourself, so ask other members of your organization for help. There's also no way you have enough good ideas to bring the organization to new heights. So get ideas from other
people! Start discussions, learn from one another. You will almost always be stronger leading as a group rather than leading alone.

That just about sums up what I've learned about leadership thus far. Let me stress that last part: **thus far**. I'm not done learning how to be a good leader. I mean, hey, I've only just graduated from college and haven't even started working yet. It would be naive to say that I know everything there is to know about leadership. But I hope that what I've written here will be useful to someone, and that perhaps others with more leadership experience can relate to some of these
ideas. Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for my next post on lifelong learning.

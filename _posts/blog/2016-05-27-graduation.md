On Sunday I graduated college, and with this major milestone in my life complete, I wanted to take some time to reflect on my years at Tufts. Mostly, I want to focus on the biggest lessons I learned while an undergraduate. These lessons are bigger than concrete skills learned in class. These are lessons which will guide me for the rest of my life.

The first is about the importance of collaboration in leadership. While at Tufts, I was fortunate enough to be elected president of the [Tufts robotics club](http://tuftsroboticsclub.com). When I first assumed the role at the start of my junior year, I was terrified! I had never led a group of students before, and I was deathly afraid of making a mistake and sinking the ship, so to speak. To avoid messing up, I worried over every little detail of the club's administration and
basically did everything myself. If we needed a poster for an event, I made it. If we were starting a new project, I was introducing and leading it. The club suffered for it, club members were bored, and all the work nearly killed me, too. There is no way I could have continued to lead the club in the same way my senior year. I realized that to be an effective leader, I need to bring other passionate club members into the fold. Not only does this make the workload more manageable -- more importantly, it means I can get their input, and thus the club can achieve more
than it ever could with only me at the helm. To be an effective leader, you have to relinquish absolute control and place your trust in your team.

I've also come to understand the importance of wisdom over intelligence as it pertains to education. I define intelligence as the ability to learn quickly and easily. This is a useful skill, don't get me wrong. But wisdom is about putting intelligence to use. I define wisdom as the ability to identify what one should learn next in order to improve oneself. It's about recognizing the gaps in your knowledge and figuring out how to fill them. An intelligent person could spend their time mastering material which is not ultimately useful to them.
A wise person carefully directs their learning to subjects which are most pertinent to their lives and aspirations. At the end of the day, I think wisdom is a whole lot more important than intelligence. I owe this lesson to Professor [Ron Lasser](http://engineering.tufts.edu/ece/people/lasser.htm) of the Tufts ECE Department. His senior design class was all about kicking the habit of assuming things we don't really know and learning *how* to fill those knowledge gaps.

While I'll miss being a student, it's good to know that what I've learned during my undergraduate career, those most valuable lessons, I carry with me now and will forever.

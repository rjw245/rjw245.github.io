On Sunday I graduated from college! For the first time
in 19 years, I am no longer a student. It's kind of hard to come to terms with, to be
honest. I've spent the past few days thinking about how fast it all went, in
spite of how long it really was. In total, I've spent 13 weeks per semester over
8 semesters at Tufts, for a total of 728 days! If I sit and think about each of
those days, for a moment my college career feels satisfyingly long, like I think
it ought to. Each day was unique and brought its own challenges, and is
memorable in its own right. However, when I think about my undergraduate
experience altogether, it once again feels so short. This is so frustrating.  These have
been the best years of my life so far, and yet they're over in the blink of an
eye.

At least I can say that I really did make the most of it. I've made the best of
friends while in college; I've grown into a leader as president of the robotics
club, [a group of amazing students](http://tuftsroboticsclub.com) building very
cool things; I've jumped out of a plane(!!!); I've helped host some very fun
parties; I've done research in a lab; I've worked a few internships and honed in
on what I really like to do (though it's always changing); I've built websites
and devices for a few different hackathons; and I've become a better teacher
working as a teaching assistant. To sum all of this up, I've seen what I
am capable of accomplishing in four years and have truly surprised myself.

**Oh yeah!** - I also hacked something together at the last minute for
graduation. Check out this video:

Pretty cool right? I taped Neopixel LED strips on the cardboard beneath the
fabric of my graduation cap and can control them with an Arduino Uno, housed
inside the cap beneath the cardboard. The Uno is a bit unwieldy -- I would have
much preferred to extract the microcontroller and put it on a small breadboard,
but time constraints forced me to put the Arduino itself in the cap. The whole
thing is powered by a portable USB battery pack sitting in my pocket, connected
via a USB cable (which runs down my back and makes me look like a robot). It all
sort of came together at the last minute, but I'm pretty happy with how it
turned out.

It's hard to believe, but on Sunday I graduated from college. For the first time
in 19 years, I am no longer a student! Kind of hard to come to terms with, to be
honest. I've spent the past few days thinking about how fast it all went. In
total, I've spent 13 weeks over 8 semesters at Tufts, for a total of 728 days! I
can sit and think about each of those days and for a moment, my college career
feels satisfyingly long, like it ought to. Each day was unique and brought its
own challenges. However, when I think about my undergraduate experience as a
whole, it goes back to feeling so short.

At least I can say that I really did make the most of it. I've made the best of
friends while in college; I've learned about leadership as president of the
robotics club, [a group of amazing students](http://tuftsroboticsclub.com)
building very cool things; I've jumped out of a plane (with a parachute don't
worry); I've helped host some very fun parties; I've done research in a lab;
I've done a few internships and honed in on what I really like to do (though
it's always changing); I've built websites and devices for a few different
hackathons; and I've become a better teacher working as a teaching assistant. I
guess to sum all of this up, I've seen what I am capable of accomplishing in
four years and have truly surprised myself.

**Oh yeah!** - I also hacked something together for graduation that was pretty
cool. Check out this video:

**INSERT VIDEO**

Pretty cool right? I taped Neopixel LED strips on the cardboard beneath the
fabric and can control them with an Arduino Uno, housed inside the fabric
beneath the cardboard. The Uno is a bit unwieldy -- I would have much preferred
to extract the microcontroller and put it on a small breadboard, but time
constraints forced me to put the Arduino itself in the cap. The whole thing is
powered by a portable USB battery pack sitting in my pocket, connected via a USB
cable (which runs down my back and makes me look like a robot).
